          "The characteristic microscopic findings of Alzheimer disease include neuritic plaques (\"senile plaques\") which are extracellular deposits of the amyloid beta-protein (Aß). In the more numerous, smaller diffuse plaques this Aß alone is present as filamentous masses. However, the diagnostic neuritic plaques also have dystrophic dilated and tortuous neurites, microglia, and surrounding reactive astrocytes. These plaques are best seen with a silver stain, as seen here in a case with many plaques of varying size. The amyloid beta-protein (Aß) is derived by cleavage of the larger amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is expressed in all mammals. In humans, the APP gene is on chromosome 21. Mutations in the APP gene have been found in familial cases of AD. Mutations in APP increase production of Aß. There are additional genetic mutations that play a role in development of AD. The E4 allele of apolipoprotein E is a major risk for AD of late onset, particularly if both alleles are E4. The gene is located on chromosome 19. Over half of AD patients have the E4 allele. Apo E4 increases levels of Aß in the brain. Mutations in the presenilin 1 gene on chromosome 14 and the presenilin 2 gene on chromosome 1 have been associated with early onset AD. These mutations increase Aß production."

          "Widespread bronchiectasis is typical for patients with cystic fibrosis who have recurrent infections and obstruction of airways by mucus throughout the lungs. About 2/3 of CF cases are due to the delta F508 mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, but there are hundreds of mutations documented. Different mutations can account for varying degrees of severity of this disease. The major problem is recurrent pulmonary infection, so keeping airways clear of viscid mucus and treating infections with antibiotics improves the quality of life and promotes longevity. The drug lumacaftor enables the abnormal CFTR protein to be transported to the cell surface, and the drug ivacaflor promotes chloride ion transport by the mutated CFTR protein."

Amylin is secreted in small amounts at the same time as insulin and slows the rate of rise of glucose in the blood. There is sufficient remaining beta cell function with type 2 diabetes mellitus to prevent ketoacidosis. However, the blood glucose can rise in conjunction with dehydration to produce the complication of hyperosmolar coma, indicated by the urinalysis findings below."

          "Atherosclerosis may involve peripheral arteries, particularly the leg, starting from the iliac arteries and extending to femoral, popliteal, and lower leg arteries. Shown here with CT angiography is an occlusion of the right popliteal artery . There is runoff into a collateral arterial branch . Complications include reduced exercise tolerance, pain, and ischemic changes that can culminate in gangrenous necrosis. The ankle-branchial index (ABI) can document peripheral vascular disease and is measured with a manual blood pressure (BP) cuff and a Doppler ultrasound device. With DU the systolic arterial occlusion pressure is measured, first at the level of the brachial artery in the arm, then at the level of the ankle. ABI is the ratio of ankle occlusion pressure to brachial artery occlusion pressure.  The ABI should normally be  1.0.  An ABI below 0.85 is consistent with PAD. Another measure of peripheral vascular disease that performed along with ABI is pulse-volume recording (PVR) of volume changes that occur with arterial blood flow into the leg.  PVR is performed by placing multiple pressure cuffs along the thigh, calf, ankle, and great toes. The cuffs are inflated to 40-60 mm Hg. Changes in the volume in the leg correlate with changes in pressure in the cuff that are recorded via a transducer over time."

It has smooth surfaces and is discrete. Such lesions are common in adults. Diminutive and small polyps are virtually always benign. Adenomas can be classified as diminutive (1 to 5 mm in diameter), small (6 to 9 mm), and large (≥10 mm).  Advanced adenomas are either ≥10 mm or are <1 cm with at least 25% villous features, high-grade dysplasia, or carcinoma. Tubulovillous denomas have 25 to 75% villous features. Villous adenomas have >75% villous architecture. Those larger than 2 cm carry a much greater risk for development of a carcinoma, having randomly collected mutations in genes such as APC , K-RAS , p53 , and DNA mismatch repair over the years. The colonoscopic appearance of rectal polyps that proved to be tubular adenomas are seen below."

There is impaired utilization of iron, without either an absolute deficiency or an excess of iron. There is cytokine-mediated blockage in transfer of iron from the storage pool to the erythroid precursors in the bone marrow. The defect is either inability to free the iron from macrophages or to load it onto transferrin. Inflammatory cytokines also depress erythropoiesis, either from action on erythroid precursors or from erythropoietin levels proportionately too low for the degree of anemia. Inflammatory conditions release cytokines such as interleukins 1 and 6 (IL1, IL6) that stimulate hepatic production of hepcidin, which reduces iron absorption and decreases release of iron from stores in macrophages. The result is decreased total serum iron, but iron binding capacity is reduced as well, resulting in a somewhat decreased saturation, but increased ferritin. Serum soluble transferrin receptors will be unaffected by chronic disease states. Anemia of chronic disease is addressed by treating the underlying condition."

The precursor to the fecal occult blood test used today was the \"guiacum test\" from the 19th century, based upon a color change in chemicals found in the occult blood resin extracted from the tropical Guajacum tree. The heme in hemoglobin provides catalase activity for a color change in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Many plants have peroxidases. Currently used guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (FOBT) reagents involve addition of hydrogen peroxide to react with heme, detected by a color change to blue. However, colonic bacteria can enzymatically degrade heme and reduce peroxidase activity. Dietary heme from meat as well as plant peroxidases can interfere with FOBT specificity and sensitivity. The fecal immunochemical test (FIT) is based upon antibodies specific to the globin in hemoglobin, so a variety of immunoassay methods can detect antibody-globin complexes, even with low concentrations of hemoglobin, and without interference from diet, drugs, or microbial flora.  The sensitivity of a single FIT may be as high as 79% for colorectal cancer and 40% for advanced polyps. Young GP, Symonds EL, Allison JE, et al.

A mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate extends from portal areas and disrupts the limiting plate of hepatocytes which are undergoing apoptosis, the so-called interface hepatitis of chronic active hepatitis. In this case, the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) were positive, but anti-HBs (seen with recovery) was negative. Presence of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) is associated with an increased risk for hepatocellular carcinoma regardless of serum level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT). The severity of infection relates to the immune system's ability to clear the virus. If clearance is delayed, a chronic persistent hepatitis can occur. A poor response can lead to chronic active hepatitis with ongoing hepatocellular damages and liver remodeling, with consequences of cirrhosis and potentially hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis B viral DNA can be measured by PCR. HBV DNA >2000 copies/mL along with an elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) suggests further workup and possible therapy is needed.  Viral copies/mL above 10,000 suggest ongoing hepatitis with greater risk for carcinoma.",

Our ability to diagnose additional agents, coupled with increased spread of these agents, has added more viruses to the potential list: SARS-CoV: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus MERS-CoV: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus HCoV-NL63: Human coronavirus NL63 HCoV-HKU1 HBoV: Human bocavirus EV-D68: Enterovirus D68 Both SARS and MERS can produce severe respiratory infection with significant (10%) fatality rate. HCoV-NL63 HCoV-HKU1, HBoV, and EV-D68 usually cause a milder, self-limiting respiratory illness. Cytomegalovirus can appear in immunocompromised hosts. Influenza A viral virulence varies considerably, as the virus undergoes genetic drift and shift with recombinations of its segmented RNA genome, particulary with shift when there are cross species shift, most often involving birds and swine. Examples include: H1N1, H1N5, H7N9."

          "The passage of a calculus (stone) through the urinary tract is diagrammed here. Calculi form when there is increased excretion of solutes such as calcium  and when urine alkalinity, acidity, stasis, and/or concentration are favorable. The most common varieties of calculi are: Type of Stone Frequency Calcium oxalate (or phosphate) 75% Magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite, or \"triple phosphate\") 12% Uric acid 6% Cystine 1% Other 6% Stones containing calcium are far more frequent than other types, and about half the time occur when there is hypercalciuria. Only about 10% of the time do they appear as a consequence of hypercalcemia. The struvite stones are also known as \"infection\" stones because bacteria such as Proteus that split urea to ammonia favor their formation. Uric acid stones may be seen in association with gout, but often are not, and may just reflect increased precipitation of urates in an acid urine. Rare cystine stones also form in acid urine. Urinary tract calculi are usually unilateral and about 1 to 3 mm in size. Their passage is marked by intense abdominal or back or flank pain. This pain can be paroxysmal, known as renal or ureteral \"colic\". Hematuria may also be present. Larger stones that cannot pass may produce hydronephrosis or hydroureter."

The IgA is deposited mainly within the mesangium, which then increases mesangial cellularity as shown at the arrow. Patients with IgA nephropathy usually present with hematuria (nephritic syndrome). Older adults may also have proteinuria, microscopic hematuria, and hypertension. Most cases are idiopathic. Some cases occur when there is defective clearance of IgA with liver disease.

About 95% of patients have the HLA-DQ2 allele, which suggests a genetic basis.",

The enzyme tissue transglutamidase breaks down gliaden into peptides that, when displayed to antigen presenting cells, activate CD4 lymphocytes that produce mucosal inflammation. Autoantibodies are found in over 90% of cases, mainly of the IgA type, including: anti-tissue transglutaminase (best), anti-gliaden, anti-reticulin, and antiendomysial antibodies. Serologic tesing is helpful for diagnosis along with a trial of a gluten-free diet. Serology and biopsy findings may be negative in persons on a gluten-free diet. Complications include an increased risk for gastrointestinal lymphoma and adenocarcinoma. Some patients have additional immunologically mediated conditions, including type I diabetes mellitus. About 20% of patients have dermatitis herpetiformis, with onset often in young adulthood.  This is a blistering skin disease caused by IgA autoantibodies directed at dermal keratinocytes.

          "This is a more subtle appearance for centrilobular emphysema in which there are \"dirty holes\" that appear focally where the central portions of lung acini have lost lung parenchyma while collecting anthracotic pigment at the same time. This pattern is typical for smokers.",
          "Smokers have a greater number of neutrophils and macrophages in their alveoli. Smoking irritates alveolar macrophages, which in turn release neutrophil chemotactic factors, such as interleukin 8, thus recruiting neutrophils. In addition, nicotine is chemotactic for neutrophils, and smoke can activate the alternative complement pathway (an inflammatory cascade). Proteases, particularly elastase, are secreted by these neutrophils and macrophages. Proteases are enzymes that are capable of digesting lung tissue and these chemicals are responsible for the damage seen in emphysema. Oxidants and free radicals in smoke also inhibit the alpha-1-antitrypsin circulating in the lung that protects alveoli from proteases. Chronic irritation by smoke also can lead to chronic bronchitis with excess production of mucus. Smoke interferes with the ciliary action of the respiratory epithelium and the mucus cannot be cleared. This predisposes the smoker to secondary and repeated infections."

These series of events in the process of inflammation are mediated by: Selectins: molecules on leukocytes (L-selectin) and endothelium (E-selectin, P-selectin) act as receptors to provide loose binding for rolling. ICAM-1: intercellular adhesion molecule 1 provides more firm adhesion of the neutrophil, via integrins on neutrophil surfaces, to the endothelium. CD31: this cell to cell adhesion molecule aids in diapedesis. C5a and LTB4: chemotaxis is aided by the C5a component from complement activation, along with leukotriene B4, a product of the lipo-oxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism. C3b and IgG: opsonins such as the C3b component from complement activation, as well as immunoglobulin G, coat foreign objects such as bacteria to aid in phagocytosis by binding to leukocyte receptors. Myeloperoxidase, lysozyme: after engulfment, killing of bacteria occurs via generation of toxic oxygen species (superoxide) converted to hydrogen peroxide and further converted to a hypochlorous radical by myeloperoxidase from neutrophil granules. In the absence of oxidation, lysozyme from neutrophil granules can form holes in microbial membranes."

The test is typically reported as positive at greater than 1:16 or 1:20 (depending upon the laboratory) to be positive at all.

A \"CBC\" (complete blood count) is a commonly ordered laboratory test that is done on this instrument and gives important data, particularly in regard to numbers of WBC's. Additional laboratory tests that may aid in diagnosis of an acute inflammatory process include measurement of \"acute phase reactants\" which are blood proteins that increase in amount, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, and serum amyloid associated protein. Such proteins will increase the sedimentation rate of RBC's, which gives another non-specific indicator of inflammation - the \"sed rate\". Procalcitonin (PCT) can be produced by a variety of cells, including liver, kidney, pancreas, and adipose tissue. PCT can act as a cytokine in a proinflammatory response. PCT is most likely to increase with bacterial infection, but trauma may also increase PCT. Therefore, PCT is a useful marker for bacterial sepsis. None of these tests will tell you exactly where the inflammation is."

In general, their appearance suggests a higher rate of cellular proliferation. Mitoses certainly are present in normal tissues (surface epithelia are constantly regenerating, and hematopoiesis produces billions of new blood cells each day). However, the presence of mitoses, and particularly abnormal mitoses, in a mass lesion supports a diagnosis of neoplasia, and likely a malignant neoplasm."

Here is an example of left ventricular cardiac hypertrophy in which there has been an increase in the size of the myocardial fibers in response to an increased pressure load from hypertension. With hypertrophy, the cells increase in size, but the cells do not increase in number. Except for being larger, the cells are normal in appearance. Alterations in cell growth can be physiologic (normal responses to stimuli) or pathologic. These alterations of cell growth are potentially reversible and include: Hypertrophy: an increase in cell size. Increase in skeletal muscle fiber size is a physiologic response to exercise, but the cardiac hypertrophy shown above is a pathologic response to abnormally elevated blood pressure. Hyperplasia: an increase in the number of cells. Postpartum breast lobules undergo hyperplasia for lactation, but endometrial hyperplasia in a postmenopausal woman is abnormal."

Radiation, either as low level long-term environmental gamma rays or as higher dose therapeutic radiation, can also produce genetic mutations in cells. Some persistent infectious agents such as human papillomavirus can lead to cellular transformation as well. Genetic damage with DNA alterations leads to point mutations of genes, translocations of genetic material between chromosomes, and gene reduplication with amplification. These alterations transform proto-oncogenes into oncogenes. The proto-oncogenes within cells may play a role in growth promotion and regulation in normal cells, perhaps in embryogenesis, but are typically \"turned off\" in adults. They are \"turned on\" by transformation and lead to the uncontrolled growth that defines neoplasia."

Metaplasia is reversible when the stimulus for it is taken away. Dysplasia: a disordered growth and maturation of an epithelium, which is still reversible if the factors driving it are eliminated."

Squamous epithelial cells may have cytoskeletal elements such as tonofilaments . Cells with neuroendocrine differentiation tend to be rounded and may have cytoplasmic neurosecretory granules . The extracellular matrix (ECM) is composed of a variety of components. An adhesion complex in the cell links to integrin that extends outward. Seen here is a basement membrane . An important component of basement membrane is laminin , which acts as a \"lag bolt\" to connect cells via integrin to the ECM. Collagen (type IV in basement membrane and types V and VI as fine fibrils ) comprises the structural component of ECM that provides shape and stability. Fibronectin is an adhesive protein that acts as a \"glue\" to hold the various components together."

          "Shown here is dilation of bowel (megacolon) proximal to the affected region of narrowing at the lower left center in sigmoid colon. Mucosal damage and secondary infection may follow. Hirschsprung disease results from an absence of ganglion cells in both submucosal and myenteric plexuses and can occur in either a segment of colon (short segment disease) or the entire colon (long segment disease). The aganglionic segment becomes narrowed, causing obstruction, with proximal dilation. Affected newborns may develop focal inflammation at the point of obstruction, with fever and diarrhea. Colonic perforation may occur. Infants with the disease may have alternating diarrhea and constipation, while children mainly have constipation. Treatment consists of surgical correction with resection of the aganglionic segment. Hirschsprung disease is thought to result from mutation of susceptible genes interacting with environmental and other factors, resulting in variable penetrance. Multiple genetic mutations have been found, but about half of familial cases and 15% of sporadic cases are associated with RET gene mutations that inactivate RET receptor kinase activity. RET promotes survival and growth of neurites and provides direction to migrating neural crest cells. The incidence of Hirschsprung disease is 1 in 5000 livebirths. It has a 4:1 male to female predominance. Short segment disease is more common in males, while the rarer long segment disease predominates in females."

Thus, the chorionic villi extend into myometrium, and the placenta cannot separate normally following delivery. Severe hemorrhage results. Abruptio placenta results from premature separation of the placenta prior to delivery, with formation of a retroplacental blood clot.

One aspect of differentiation is shown in the left panel with a PAS stain, highlighting red-staining mucin in vacuoles in neoplastic cell cytoplasm, characteristic of a neoplasm derived from glandular epithelium. Note characteristics of a neoplasm. There are small vessels (angiogenesis factors are secreted by neoplastic cells) to support the tumor. There is a stroma with connective tissue and extracellular matrix to provide a supporting framework for tumor growth. Malignant neoplastic cells are not robust, and tend to become necrotic, and may express tumor antigens, and both of these characteristics can incite an inflammatory response. In general, less differentiation of a neoplasm means a greater likelihood of malignant behavior. This is the basis for histologic grading of malignant neoplasms. The less differentiated, the higher the grade, and the more aggressive the malignant neoplasm is likely to be. (Benign neoplasms aren't graded, since by definition they are well-differentiated.)"

With DU the systolic arterial occlusion pressure is measured, first at the level of the brachial artery in the arm, then at the level of the ankle. ABI is the ratio of ankle occlusion pressure to brachial artery occlusion pressure.  The ABI should normally be  1.0.  An ABI below 0.85 is consistent with PAD. Another measure of peripheral vascular disease that performed along with ABI is pulse-volume recording (PVR) of volume changes that occur with arterial blood flow into the leg.  PVR is performed by placing multiple pressure cuffs along the thigh, calf, ankle, and great toes. The cuffs are inflated to 40-60 mm Hg. Changes in the volume in the leg correlate with changes in pressure in the cuff that are recorded via a transducer over time."

Acute inflammation is a non-selective process that can lead to tissue destruction. Thus, it is best if the response is fast and localized, so that tissue destruction is minimal, and this is what happens most of the time. Clinically apparent inflammatory disease processes are characterized by more extensive, ongoing inflammation. When necrosis of cells occurs, there is release of cytoplasmic contents, some of which may find their way into circulation. Some cytoplasmic contents, such as enzymes, may be more specific for some tissues than others, and measuring them in the peripheral blood gives an indication of where the inflammation and necrosis may be. Thus, creatine kinase (CK) elevations suggest damage to striated muscle, while elevation of serum lipase is more specific for pancreas, and an elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) suggests hepatocyte injury. Some enzymes, such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) can come from many tissue sources."

One of these infections occurs with human papillomavirus (HPV), which is sexually transmitted. The HPV infection causes abnormal proliferation of the squamous cells over years' time. Out of this abnormal proliferation can arise mutations in the cells which lead to loss of growth control. The first sign of loss of control is seen as a disordered maturation of the cells from bottom basal layer to top, known as dysplasia. These abnormal cells appear on the surface and can be collected by scraping them off and placing them on a slide (Pap smear). The dysplasia can be diagnosed by the appearance of the cells on the slide. The dysplasia can be treated before it progresses to cancer."

The cells of the cancer have large, irregular, dark nuclei. The cancer cells are extending (invading) into the dermis. There are a variety of problems that occur with sun exposure. Sunlight, specifically ultraviolet light, damages the skin. The elastic fibers in the dermis are degraded so that the skin loses its elasticity and wrinkles appear. The cells of the epidermis are damaged to become more prone to give rise to skin cancers. One form of skin cancer is squamous cell carcinoma, so-called because the cells of the cancer mimic, at least somewhat, normal squamous cells. Sunburn: Excessive exposure to sunlight will produce a sunburn. Some persons are more sensitive than others, based on the amount of melanin pigment and other factors present. The burn causes the outer layer of skin, the epidermis, to die and peel off. The same thing can happen with an accidental burn from fires and hot liquids and can be worse. If the basal layer of cells of the epidermis is left, or there are adnexal structures left (sweat glands and sebaceous glands which have epithelial cells) then the epidermis can regenerate itself and heal. If no epithelial cells are left, then the burned area must have a skin graft placed over it, as is the case with severe burn injuries."

          "Correlation 19: Hirschsprung Disease The normal colon has ganglion cells within myenteric plexuses (as shown here) and submucosal plexuses. An absence of these ganglion cells in both layers can occur in either a segment of colon (short segment disease) or the entire colon (long segment disease). The aganglionic segment becomes narrowed, causing obstruction, with proximal dilation. Affected newborns may develop focal inflammation at the point of obstruction, with fever and diarrhea. Colonic perforation may occur. Infants with the disease may have alternating diarrhea and constipation, while children mainly have constipation. Treatment consists of surgical correction with resection of the aganglionic segment. Hirschsprung disease is thought to result from mutation of susceptible genes interacting with environmental and other factors, resulting in variable penetrance. Multiple genetic mutations have been found, but about half of familial cases and 15% of sporadic cases are associated with RET gene mutations that inactivate RET receptor kinase activity. RET promotes survival and growth of neurites and provides direction to migrating neural crest cells. The incidence of Hirschsprung disease is 1 in 5000 livebirths. It has a 4:1 male to female predominance. Short segment disease is more common in males, while the rarer long segment disease predominates in females."

Loss of epithelium in a localized area is called ulceration. The protection afforded by the epithelium is lost. A good example of this occurs in the upper gastrointestinal tract in the form of peptic ulcer disease involving the stomach and duodenum. These ulcers result from the presence of acid secreted by the mucosa of the stomach. The normal epithelium is designed to resist this acid, principally because of the mucus that is secreted over the surface of the epithelium by cells in the mucosa that produce mucus. One predisposing factor for peptic ulcers is the presence of an infection with the organism called Helicobacter pylori . This little bacterium grows happily in the overlying gastric mucus and, by itself, does not cause any damage. However, the growth of the H. pylori organisms changes the physiology of the epithelium to make it function less effectively so that ulcers can occur. Billions of dollars are spent each year in the U.S. on drugs that can either reduce acid secretion or inhibit growth of H. pylori . Any normal epithelium is normally replacing itself in days to weeks, so epithelial surfaces have the capacity to easily regrow, which is a good thing. Inhibiting the causes for peptic ulcers allows the epithelium to regrow and heal the ulcer."

          "Correlation 1: Bone fracture At medium power magnification, bone spicules have broken ends as a consequence of a fracture of bone, and there is callus formation along with areas of loose connective tissue and blood vessels . A break in a bone is known as a fracture. It is a good thing that connective tissues of the body have the capacity to heal themselves, because fractures can heal. In the region of the break, new blood vessels grow to form a highway carrying cells that can clean up the mess and can start forming new connective tissue. One of the most prominent cells in this process is the fibroblast, which can produce collagen. In the region of the fracture, a mass of collagenous material forms, and this is called a callus, which stabilizes the fracture and creates a template on which new bone can be laid down. On average, the whole process takes six to eight weeks (the standard answer to any orthopedic question). This process is much more efficient in children than adults. The standard of practice nowadays for fractures in adults is for orthopedic surgeons to put in metal plates and screws to stabilize the fracture and set it so that healing occurs without deformity (a bent bone). Joint injuries: There are two areas in the body that are particularly prone to injury to tendinous connective tissue: the rotator cuff of the shoulder and the anterior cruciate ligament of the knee. As people age, their connective tissues become less resilient and less able to take stresses and strains. Injuries in our modern society are more likely to be sports related, because there are more middle aged and older adults trying to recapture lost youth through sports activities (basketball, football, tae-kwon-do, etc). Too much strain on tendinous tissue can lead to tears which render the joints less stable. Orthopedic surgeons can try and repair such damage, as in the case of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), which can even be replaced with a graft."

The remaining large spaces have less overall surface area than the normal lung. The normal alveolar air sacs are uniformly sized and allow sufficient surface area for gas exchange to occur (inhaled oxygen diffusing into the bloodstream and carbon dioxide diffusing out into the alveoli to be exhaled). One of the changes that occurs to the lung with smoking is loss of alveoli. This process is known as emphysema. The loss of alveoli is permanent and irreversible."

An important component of basement membrane is laminin , which acts as a \"lag bolt\" to connect cells via integrin to the ECM. Collagen ( type IV in basement membrane and type VII as fine fibrils ) comprises the structural component of ECM that provides shape and stability. Collagen fibrils are woven like rope and are very sturdy. They have a characteristic periodicity by electron microscopy.

Creatine phosphate supplies the energy for the first few seconds of muscle contraction, followed by energy generated from aerobic metabolism or anaerobic glycolysis. Mitochondria supply the ATP to power aerobic contraction. The myoglobin within the myofiber binds oxygen and aids in diffusion of oxygen into the fiber. More myoglobin and more mitochondria are found in type 1 ('slow twitch', oxidative) fibers for sustained contraction. More glycogen, but no myoglobin, provides fast ATP generation via glycolysis in type 2 ('fast twitch', glycolytic) fibers for rapid strength of contraction.

      "atAGlance": "<ul><li><b>Genetics:</b> Genetically heterogeneous, with autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked inheritance patterns described.</li><li><b>Pathophysiology:</b> The primary defect is in the rods, leading to their progressive death. Cone degeneration follows later in the disease course.</li><li><b>Clinical Presentation:</b> The classic initial symptom is <mark>night blindness (nyctalopia)</mark> due to rod dysfunction. This is followed by a progressive loss of the <mark>peripheral visual field</mark>, leading to 'tunnel vision.' Central vision is typically spared until late in the disease.</li><li><b>Fundoscopy:</b> The classic triad of findings includes:<br>1. <b>Bone spicule-like pigmentation</b> in the mid-periphery of the retina.<br>2. <b>Arteriolar attenuation</b> (narrowing of retinal vessels).<br>3. <b>Optic disc pallor</b>.</li><li><b>Associated Conditions:</b> Can be a feature of systemic syndromes like Usher syndrome (RP and deafness) and abetalipoproteinemia.</li><li><b>USMLE Tip:</b> A young patient complaining of difficulty seeing at night and bumping into things in their peripheral vision, with bone spicules on fundoscopy, is the classic presentation of retinitis pigmentosa.</li></ul>",
